For running the Java code, click on the Jar file located in:

Appendix 2\Java Code\out\artifacts\NafiseDissertation_jar

In this jar, the program asks you to enter the required data.

Once the program collected all the data, it generates a csv file that can be used as a feeder to the R code.

For running the r code that are located in Appendix 3, use the generated user CSV as the test set and a complete CSV file as the train set.

To do so, the user should change the paths to the aformentioned files' paths in the R code.
